# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Lab Overview

What do you do if you arenâ€™t physically near the computer you need to work on?  

Up until now, our Lab activities have been done directly on our laptops. In this activity, we explore the concept of **servers**, which are often located somewhere else. We will connect to them **remotely** and perform tasks as if we were on the server itself.  

This Lab focuses on understanding and practicing remote system access.
